Welcome to the GitHub page for the Discord WEBP to PNG Converter! This extension automatically converts Discord WEBP images to PNG right for you, without you having to do a thing!

# How it works
1. Once installed, the extension has a script that automatically looks for &format=webp in a page to convert to &format=png. The reason PNG was chosen for this extension is because of its common use already and the fact that there were some issues encountered when attempting to convert to other formats.

# How can I use it?
You can download the extension from the Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/discord-webp-to-png/cldkbhaidinccpieefdemgphgifggmcb
It is currently pending upload to Mozilla Web Store.
Alternatively, you may download the source here and load it in chrome://extensions (edge://extensions on Edge) or about:debugging on Mozilla Firefox.
